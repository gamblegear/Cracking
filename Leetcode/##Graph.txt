1. Dealing with graph - should care about how many vertexes and build visited array on top of this

2. Graph traverse needs to set those to be visited and dont need to set them back while loop detection requires to set those vertex back

3. DFS - performance improvement - for initialization, set int[] visited (=0), if the vertex has been visited and no loop detected, 
  can set this to be 1 and for those loop detected vertex, set them to be -1

4. BFS - for directed graph - start from the entry point which have 0 inbound
