1. two pointers.

2. recursion until the last element.

3. charAt().

4. Scan from both sides (left and right) and keep record of the lhs/rhs value in arrays.

5. Play with subString, especially for problems in recursion.

6. When calling substring(), need to make sure there is no overflow, one method is to check: 
   i1 < s1.length() && i2 < s2.length() && i3 < s3.length() && s1.charAt(i1) == s3.charAt(i3);
   also, when using substring - substring(s.length()) is acceptable and result is "";
