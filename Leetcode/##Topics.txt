## Palindrome
(palidrome partitioning, palidrome partitioning II)
- need a helper function isPalindrome
- do NOT necessarily think from the middle of string, when doing sub string - can always use head and tail

## Wrapper
Wrapper can be used to pass back or process more than one parameter. Usually requires to have a comparator.

## Comparator
- Can be finished by creating the Comparator Object and initialize its compare function
- Directly overwrite the Collections.sort function (here still create the Comparator object)

Collections.sort(edges, new Comparator<Edge>() {
		public int compare(Edge a, Edge b) {
			if (a.x != b.x)
				return Integer.compare(a.x, b.x);
 
			if (a.isStart && b.isStart) {
				return Integer.compare(b.height, a.height);
			}
 
			if (!a.isStart && !b.isStart) {
				return Integer.compare(a.height, b.height);
			}
 
			return a.isStart ? -1 : 1;
		}
	});

## Union Searc
- Build the list/map which contains the connected area - once the probe falls into the targeted area, all elements in the area will be visited.
- Universal container can be declared as global variable for the class
- matrix's X and Y can be can be calculated by "x = cur / n & y = cur % n"
- A great idea is to teak the original matrix a littble bit (change the target) and proceed with the remaining
